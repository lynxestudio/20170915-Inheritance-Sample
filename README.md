# Understanding Inheritance in C#
    
<p align="justify">
      Inspired from biological modeling, inheritance allows new classes to be constructed that inherit characteristics (fields and methods) from ancestor classes while typically introducing more specialized characteristics, new fields, or methods. A subclass is logically considered to be a specialized version or extension of its parent and by inference its ancestor classes.
 </p>
      <p align="justify">
        In programming, you often create a model of something, and then need a more specialized version of that original model.

        These codes illustrate the duplication of attributes between Manager class and the Employee class. Additionally, there could be a number of methods applicable to both classes.
          In object-oriented languages, special mechanisms are provided that enable you define a class in terms of a previously defined class.

      <p align="justify">
      One of its main mechanism is called <i>Inheritance</i>. <i>Inheritance</i> is a form of software reusability in which classes are created by absorbing an existing classâ€™s data and behaviors and embellishing them with new capabilities.
      The next figure shows the diagram in which the <i>Manager</i> is a derived class of <i>Employee</i> base class.

      <h3>Single Inheritance</h3>
      <p align="justify">The C# programming language permits a class to extend one other class only. This restriction is called single inheritance. With single inheritance, a class is derived from one base class. C# does not support multiple inheritance.</p>
      <p align="justify">
        Once created, each derived class can become the base class for future derived classes. Typically, the derived class contains the behaviors of its base class. Therefore, a derived class is more specific than its base class and represents a more specialized group of objects.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        The next image shows the base class Employee and three derived classes: <i>Engineer</i>, <i>Manager</i> and <i>Secretary</i>. The <i>Manager</i> is also the base class from which the derived class <i>Director</i> explicitly inherits.
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        The <i>Employee</i> class contains three attributes (Name, Salary, and BirthDate), as well as one method (GetDetails). The <i>Manager</i> class inherits all of these members and specifies an additional attribute, department, as well as the <i>GetDetails</i> method. The <i>Director</i> class inherits all of the members of <i>Employee</i> and <i>Manager</i> and specifies a CarAllowance attribute and a new method, IncreaseAllowance.
